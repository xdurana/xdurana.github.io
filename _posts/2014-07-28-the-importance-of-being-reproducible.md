[Reproducible Research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research) (RR) or reproducible data analysis is the idea and practice to complement scholarly journal articles with all the information needed to reproduce the results they present.

> Very often scientific studies rely on complex textual explanations of what has been done to analyze the data that can overwhelm the reader that has to accept them as an act of faith.

To avoid this, a good way to understand better what has been done is to provide the raw data and an univoque description of the procedures used to analyze it. This practice will allow the scientific community to reproduce the results, work along with the data and assert the validity of the results.

Many tools have appeared with the advent of [Big Data](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/blog/?p=4238) and the need to analyze large datasets, specially around [R, a language](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/what-r	) and environment for statistical computing and graphics thatâ€™s becoming a kind of standard de facto in open science.

Here are some tools of the R ecosystem that allows to publish the results along with the methods and the data.

### Tools for Reproducibility

- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) IDE is a powerful and productive user interface for R, free, open source and multiplatform.
- [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) is a collection of analyses and methods can be easily shared, replicated, and extended by other researchers, accessible through the R statistical programming environment.
- [KnitR](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is an elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R that allows to incorporate R, Python and other live code snippets in a document, and comes packaged with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
- [Slidify](http://slidify.org/) is a tool to write slides in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), a format that combines the core syntax of Markdown with embedded code chunks that are executed.
- [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/) is a tool to publish and share directly from [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
