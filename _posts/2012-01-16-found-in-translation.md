This year we have some web projects to develop on the horizon and it’s a good time to take a look at the tools that shall help us to handle them and the challenges we’re going to face. When building our [labs website](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu), more than a year ago, we opted for [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), a free and open source [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) written in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) with a [huge development community](http://drupal.org/community) behind it.

Drupal is not a monolithic piece of software. The core, the part of the software that contains the basic features of the CMS, is common to all installations. But the thing that makes Drupal one of the developers’ favourite choice is its modularity.

One thing that I’m concerned with is to make the website multilingual without having to duplicate all the structure. This blog and the [labs website](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu) are only in english but our library tools ([library website](http://biblioteca.uoc.edu), [catalogue](http://cataleg.uoc.edu/search*eng), electronic resources) are in catalan, english and spanish. Hopefully, [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0), the new version, has resolved most of the problems that can be faced on a multilingual environment by adding new features by building internationalization modules.

Below you can find some resources that explain perfectly all the possibilities to make a multilingual website. So, good coding and take care!
