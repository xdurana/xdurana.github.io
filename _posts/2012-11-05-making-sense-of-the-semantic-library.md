On previous posts we have been talking about the [linked](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/blog/?p=2603) and [open](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/blog/?p=683) data. The library, working as a publisher in open repositories, has an opportunity to enrich and connect its data to the semantic web through the integration of data from the Linked Open Data cloud. Other issues to be concerned with are matching and linking of published datasets or the use of authority files for dataÂ enhancement.

These are some of the questions that are thrown in the following list of conferences and resources about the semantic web to start thinking about why it makes sense for academic libraries.
