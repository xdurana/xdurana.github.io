Last week finished the [Big Data Week](http://bigdataweek.com/) [#bdw14](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bdw14&src=typd), the third edition of an international event orgnaized in more than 30 cities worldwide ([Barcelona](http://bigdataweek.com/barcelona/) among them) with lectures, discussions, workshops and presentations on the impact of [Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) on different aspects of the society. [CCCB](http://www.cccb.org/en/) hosted most of the events in Barcelona, and it was organized also by [Catalunya Dades](http://catalunyadades.wordpress.com/) and [media140](http://media140.com/). In the event’s setting, [UOC](http://www.uoc.edu/) and [Catalunya Dades](http://catalunyadades.wordpress.com/) organize the second edition of [introductory course to open data](http://oer.uoc.edu/cursOpenData/), instructed by UOC’s professor [Julià Minguillón](http://www.uoc.edu/webs/jminguillona/EN/curriculum/). But if you missed it and you are interested in Big Data, the CCCB hosts until 26th October an exposition curated by [Olga Subirós](https://twitter.com/osubiros) and [José Luis de Vicente](https://twitter.com/jldevicente) exploring the datification of the world and its consequences.

> The [Big Bang Data](http://bigbangdata.cccb.org/en/) exhibition explores the emergence of the database as a framework for cultural and political thinking and the effects of datafication of the world.

In the exhibition we would demistify the [Internet Machine](http://bigbangdata.cccb.org/en/internet-machine-timo-arnall-2/) on Timo Arnall’s installation, learn about the [basic vocabulary of Big Data](http://bigbangdata.cccb.org/en/basic-vocabulary-big-data/) or [visualize the complexity](http://bigbangdata.cccb.org/en/visual-complexity-manuel-lima/) of the world through data among other exhibitions. A good opportunity to grasp the deluge of information in a more experiential way.
