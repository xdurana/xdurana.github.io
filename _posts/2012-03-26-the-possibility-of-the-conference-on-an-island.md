The [ELAG 2012 Conference](http://www.elag2012.com/), for the application of information technology in libraries and documentation centres, is just around the corner. And our neighbours from the [Universitat de les Illes Balears](http://www.uib.eu/?languageId=1) will host this year's edition in Palma de Mallorca, from May 15th to May 18th. And the [CBUC](http://www.cbuc.cat/cbuc_en) is participating on the organization. We’re sure it’ll be a complete success!

[Libraries everywhere](http://www.elag2012.com/2012-conference/) is the main topic of the Conference, with the focus on the mobile technologies —yes, that modern tools that allow users to satisfy their informational needs on new different and awkward ways that weren’t possible in the past.

The first day is the [pre-conference](http://www.elag2012.com/programme/pre-conference/), where there are different bootcamps to participate in: from Web Services developement to jQuery or library data analysis tools among others. Is an interesting way to plunge into a topic you’re interested in for a day and share experiences with other participants. The following three days there’s the Conference itself, with presentations alternating with workshops.

[Last year in Prague](http://elag2011.techlib.cz/en/) we presented our [library website redesign](http://www.slideshare.net/xdurana/what-should-a-virtual-library-environment-look-like) and we’re just on the process of developing it. This year we’ve been busy with many other projects, including the implementation of a [metaindex search engine on the cloud](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/blog/?p=2282) and a [library data analysis tool](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/labs/cyclops) of our own. The [registration](http://www.elag2012.com/registration/) is open, and we hope we’ll be there to share the experience with you!
