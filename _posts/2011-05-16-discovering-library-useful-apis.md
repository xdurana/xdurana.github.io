title: Discovering library useful API's

There's many [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and [web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) that can be used to create mashups, or web applications that combine data from multiple sources within a single tool. Roy Tennant ([@rtennant](http://twitter.com/#!/rtennant)) mantains a wide selection of [Library Application Program Interfaces](http://techessence.info/apis/) in his webpage, and is a very good starting point to discover what data is available for us to mash up with our own library data.

[Karen Coombs](http://www.librarywebchic.net/about/) ([@librarywebchic](http://twitter.com/#!/librarywebchic)) from [OCLC](http://www.oclc.org/developer/) is also working on it and we can learn from her presentations, like [Library Web Services: Mashups and APIs](http://www.librarywebchic.net/218-2/library-web-services-mashups-apis/) and also [Web Services for Libraries: Tips, Code Samples, Explanations and Downloads](http://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/talks/il2008-workshop-webservices-handout.pdf), where Jason A. Clark ([@jaclark](http://twitter.com/#!/jaclark)) and herself show some practical examples.

[Linked Data in Libraries](http://791linkeddata.blogspot.com/) is also another interesting blog where many contributors explain their experiences with different API and tools. So there's no excuses to start mashing up your library data!
