On today's date, 7th March, back in 1999 [Stanley Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick), one of the most influential film directors ever, died in England. He gave us some masterpieces such as Lolita, A Clockwork Orange or The Shining as we can see in this [timeline](http://www.timelineindex.com/content/view/715).

Maybe we are not as influential as he was, but we have more than 10 years of Virtual Library innovation work, improving everyday and working hard to offer high-tech value solutions for our University community. Now that we have just released our Labs site, it’s a good opportunity to review what we have done so far. Once upon a time, in September 1995, our Virtual Library was born and began the history that we have now tried to explain in the [UOC’s Virtual Library timeline](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/labs/timeline).

Given that we know that “all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”, and we don’t want to be caught snoozing at work, we had been playing with [some](http://www.dipity.com/) timeline solutions until we stumbled upon the [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) [SMILE Widgets](http://www.simile-widgets.org/) [timeline](http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/). It is an [open-source](http://simile.mit.edu/license.html) piece of code written in HTML and JavaScript, which is [very well documented](http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline) and [configurable](http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/examples/index.html). It is very easy to get to work. We have only had to plug in a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) file with our [library events information](http://labs.biblioteca.uoc.edu/timeline/events.js). Try it. It’s a piece of cake!
