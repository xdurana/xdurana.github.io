I'm a Computer Engineer with a [Master in Cognitive Systems](http://csim.upf.edu/). Now I'm part of the [Disease Genomics](http://www.imppc.org/research-activities/disease_genomics/) group at the [Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer](http://www.imppc.org/) working on the tools behind the [GCAT cohort study](http://www.gcatbiobank.org/). Previously I worked in learning technologies at the [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](http://www.uoc.edu/).

When not changing the world, I enjoy theatre, playing [chess](http://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=2212820), [running](http://smashrun.com/xdurana) & [hiking](https://www.feec.cat/activitats/100-cims/llista-de-cims/?usuari=57671).
